<h1>Project history</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www2.giganet.net/~yoshi/">original ruby-opengl</a> was written
by Yoshi.</p>
<p>James A. desperately wanted to get the OpenGL Ruby bindings working on his Mac,
but they wouldn&#8217;t even compile on <span class="caps">OSX</span>. After a little bit of tweaking, he made
his patched bindings available to the ruby community in a very informal manner.</p>
<p>John G. then wanted to clean it up and add some docs to it, and so started
tweaking and put up a new site and made his changes available.</p>
<p>Then Peter M. came along and decided to try updating ruby-opengl using <span class="caps">SWIG</span>,
as it seemed easier than doing everything by hand. Peter wrote the new code,
John started the actual RubyForge project, put up a new site, and Peter
committed the code.</p>
<p>Thu M. V. joined the project with a lot of energy, and the mailing list
was showing a good bit of activity.</p>
<p>After some experience, we began to question whether <span class="caps">SWIG</span> was necessary/helpful
for a project of this nature.  The leaning was that people want to abandon
<span class="caps">SWIG</span> and go back to maintaining the binding files by hand. Thu even provided
a script to help with the manual coding that would be required without using
<span class="caps">SWIG</span>.</p>
<p>The reasoning at the time was:</p>
<p>Pro-<span class="caps">SWIG</span>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Could use the .i files for another project, perhaps (<span class="caps">OTOH</span>, we couldn&#8217;t
  use previous .i files on this project&#8230;)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>It&#8217;s supposed to require less manual coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Con-<span class="caps">SWIG</span>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>yet another tool to learn</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>OpenGL isn&#8217;t really all that big</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>OpenGL doesn&#8217;t change a lot</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A lot of boilerplate and overhead in the generated files because <span class="caps">SWIG</span> is
  a general tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>In September 2006, we stopped using <span class="caps">SWIG</span>. Thu and Peter began fine tuning
Thu&#8217;s original <code>utils/mkwrap.rb</code> script.</p>
<p>Development stalled in October 2006.</p>
<p>Development picked up again towards the end of 2006. After a long hiatus 
and getting a new release of mkrf out the door, version 0.33 (following the
numbering of original Yoshi&#8217;s bindings which stalled at 0.32) was released.</p>
<p>During first half of 2007, we added large portion of code, as well as number
of unit tests, creating near-complete support for OpenGL 2.1.
Support for MS Windows was also added during this time.</p>
<p>Version 0.40 was released in July 2007.</p>
<p>Version 0.50 was released in October 2007.</p>
<p>Version 0.60 was released in December 2007.</p>
<p>After the development stopped on April 1st, 2009 (after being developed for
a long time by only Jan D.), Eric H. picked up the development in 2011 and
modernized the library. In 2012 Lars K. took over.</p>
<p>The opengl gem 0.70 and 0.80 was released in February 2013. ruby-opengl now
forwards to the opengl gem.</p>

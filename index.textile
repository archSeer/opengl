h1(logo). opengl

An OpenGL wrapper for Ruby. Contains bindings for OpenGL.
Available for Windows, Linux and OS X. GLUT, GLU and GLFW were split
into standalone gems. The documentation, however, is still stored here.

This is the main documentation site for ruby bindings of OpenGL related
libraries.

h2. Synopsis

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'opengl'
# (code sample of usage)
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.2+ (see "0.7":https://github.com/larskanis/opengl/tree/0.7 for Ruby 1.8.x compatible branch)
* OpenGL development files installed
* GLU and (free-)GLUT development files installed for glu/glut gem.

h2. Install

{% highlight sh %}
gem install opengl
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Developers

After checking out the source, run:

{% highlight sh %}
$ rake newb
{% endhighlight %}

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs,
and generate the RDoc.

h2. Cross compiling for Windows

h3. opengl

Using rake-compiler a cross compiled opengl gem can be build on a Linux or MacOS X
host for the win32 platform. The generated gem is statically linked against
libfreeglut. Freeglut is downloaded and compiled from the sources.
There are no runtime dependencies to any but the standard Windows
DLLs.

Install mingw32 or w64 using the instructions in rake-compiler's README.
For Debian/Ubuntu it is <tt>apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64</tt> .

Download and cross compile ruby 1.9 for win32 with:

{% highlight sh %}
rake-compiler cross-ruby VERSION=1.9.3-p0
{% endhighlight %}

Download and cross compile opengl for win32:

{% highlight sh %}
rake cross native gem
{% endhighlight %}

or with custom versions:

{% highlight sh %}
rake cross native gem RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.9.3 LIBFREEGLUT_VERSION=2.8.0
{% endhighlight %}

If everything works, there should be a @ruby-opengl-VERSION-x86-mingw32.gem@ in the pkg
directory.

h3. glut

The generated gem is statically linked against libfreeglut. Freeglut is downloaded
and compiled from the sources. There are no runtime dependencies to any but the
standard Windows DLLs. The procedure is more or less the same as with opengl.

One can specify a custom version of freeglut:

{% highlight sh %}
rake cross native gem RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.9.3 LIBFREEGLUT_VERSION=2.8.0
{% endhighlight %}
